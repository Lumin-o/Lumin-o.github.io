      <div id="text1"><p width="100%" height="100%">Hello my name is Diego Silva and I am a 9th grade student at GEMS World Academy. I am 14 years old and my birthday is on June 29th. I am a Chicago native and I am half Colombian and half Venezuelan. I have an older brother and a dog that is a Chocolate Labrador. I also have a job at a Brazilian Cafe called Mulata.

      <img id="me" src="photos/me.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"><div id="text2"> <p width="100%" height="100%">Some hobbies of mine are that I like to practice new recipes that I can share with my family and I like to take care of dogs. Some sports I like to play are Soccer, Basketball, and Volleyball. Some interest of mine are that I would like to take some finance classes because they would help me manage my money better. I would also like to to look into stocks and crypto currency because both of them have been going up in value. </p> </div>

 <div id="text3">
      <p> My goal's in life are to enjoy my time on Earth to the max. Also, I would like to create my own crypto currency or NFT and hopefully it would become high in value. It might be simple to you but for me it takes a lot of time to trust in somebody. You might not trust in somebody because your scared, worried, or nervoius. In life I want to be able to money work for me not me working for money. Meaning that my assets would bring in money that I barely would have to work. Lastly, I would like to go to some culinary classes and learn to cook some very complicated dishes that I can cook for my family. </p>
